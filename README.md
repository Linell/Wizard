## Wizard

Wizard is a dorky little game written in CoffeeScript using HTML5 canvas. It sucks.

### Installation and Compilation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linell/Wizard
cd Wizard
npm install
npm run compile
```

I use [serve](http://get-serve.com/) to create the little webserver that runs it. To do that,

```bash
gem install serve
```

Now, you can simply say

```bash
serve
```

and you're up and running on localhost:4000. Navigate there and *boom* you're playing Wizard.
